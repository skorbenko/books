	<h2>"Why the West Rules" Impression </h2>
	<i>please note: this impression is an excerpt from a letter to my friend.</i>
	<p>As for "Why the West Rules", my opinion has stayed largely the same, but I found myself realizing something important. I always wondered if, just maybe, the democratic notion I was taught in London- that all people are equal- is wrong. This book finally proved to me, scientifically, that there are no reasons for racism whatsoever, and racists are mostly uncultured humans who don't read many books or scientific articles/papers. </p>
