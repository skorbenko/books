<li><strong>Happy people are productive people.</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Seven Principles</strong>

<ol>
<li>The Happiness Advantage

<ul>
<li>Happiness is pleasure combined with deeper feelings of meaning and purpose.</li>
<li>Happiness is human flourishing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Fulcrum &amp; the Lever

<ul>
<li> Happiness is not about lying to ourselves; it is about adjusting our brains so that we can see above our circumstances.</li>
<li> Our external reality is far more dependent on the eyes of the viewer then we think</li>
<li> The Workaholic&rsquo;s Curse: viewing family time and relaxation as unproductive, which makes said time unproductive instead of relaxing.</li>
<li> View your work as a calling, not a job or a career.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Tetris Effect

<ul>
<li>Paradise becomes hell when all you can see are the problems.</li>
<li>Lawyers are 3.6x likely to suffer from depression than the general population. They are taught to be critical, not accepting.</li>
<li>Can be stopped/improved via

<ul>
<li>Happiness</li>
<li>Gratitude</li>
<li>Optimism</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Falling Up

<ul>
<li>Our mind creates a map with three paths in the face of adversity:

<ol>
<li>The situation stays as it is, circling around.</li>
<li>The situation turns negative.</li>
<li>One becomes stronger than ever before.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The ability to find the optimal path depends largely on how one views the circumstances - whether one is happy or not.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Zorro Circle

<ul>
<li>One shall limit one&rsquo;s focus to a small circle before one can expand.</li>
<li>One could set a time limit and only work on current tasks as an example of a circle.</li>
<li>There are two modes for our brain - the jerk and the thinker. (Quick and complex/rational thinking)</li>
<li>Make two lists: things you can control, and things you can&rsquo;t.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The 20-Second Rule

<ul>
<li>Humans are mere bundles of habits</li>
<li>Willpower is not the answer</li>
<li>Common sense =/= common action</li>
<li>If there&rsquo;s something you want to do, lower the required activation energy. The same principle can be inverted.</li>
<li>How can one change one&rsquo;s defaults?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Social Investment

<ul>
<li>Relationships are vital to health; they are hardwired into our biology.</li>
<li>For one, being a reliable friend is important before one needs a friend.</li>
<li>One can always invest in an offensive line.</li>
<li>Glue guys - people who hold teams together, but one can&rsquo;t tell what exactly they do.</li>
<li>The response you have to other people is incredibly important.</li>
<li>A passive response to good news is a negative response.</li>
<li>Gratitude sparks upward growth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>The Broadening Effect</strong>:  Positive emotions flood one&rsquo;s brain with dopamine and serotonin, they improve one&rsquo;s learning centers (easier to memorize and learn), make one keep information longer &amp; retreat it faster, allows one to think quicker and more creatively, more skilled with complex problem solving.</li>
<li><strong>One&rsquo;s happiness levels can be increased</strong> using:

<ul>
<li>Conscious acts of kindness</li>
<li>Finding something to look forward to</li>
<li>Spending money on experiences</li>
<li>Exercise</li>
<li>Meditation</li>
<li>You can choose to be happy, and the circumstances will change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
