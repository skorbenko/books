	<h2>"Why Zebras don't get Ulcers" Impression </h2>
	<i>please note: this impression is an excerpt from a letter to my friend.</i>
	<p>Anyway, I've also finished "Why Zebras don't get Ulcers", and I feel it has contributed to my understanding of the world significantly, as stress is something of a big part in my life- I don't fit in with the Russian educational system, so every single exam or angry teacher brings me stress. I think a valuable lesson from that book is finding a hobby you love and that releases your stress. For me, that's writing for my new blog, which I've only just started this January.</p>
