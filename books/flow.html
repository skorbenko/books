<h1>Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</h1>

<ul>
<li>Flow is optimal experience.</li>
<li><strong>Optimal experience occurs when a person&rsquo;s body or mind is stretched to its limit in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult or worthwhile.</strong></li>
<li>The goal is not a comfortable life; it is a life worth living.</li>
<li>The more one is in flow, the happier one is.</li>
<li><strong>8 Components of Enjoyment</strong>

<ol>
<li>Confront tasks one can complete</li>
<li>One concentrates</li>
<li>The task has clear goals</li>
<li>The task provides immediate feedback</li>
<li>Removes awareness of everyday life</li>
<li>Allows to exercise a sense of control</li>
<li>The sense of yourself disappears, but is even stronger afterwards</li>
<li>The sense of the duration of time seems altered</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Happiness is not something that happens; it is a condition that must be prepared for, cultivated and defended privately by each person.</li>
<li>The more one gets into Flow, the easier it becomes.</li>
<li>One must read books that are above one&rsquo;s level, looking up words in the dictionary.</li>
<li><strong>Ways to experience Flow at work:</strong>

<ol>
<li>Change the constraints and opportunities for expressing freedom/creativity</li>
<li>Change the job itself until the conditions are conducive to Flow</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>50% of people experience apathy during leisure</li>
<li>For most people, 50% of the time at work is spent in Flow</li>
<li>A major catastrophe that frustrates a central goal of life will either destroy the self, forcing a person to use all his psychic energy to erect a barrier around remaining goals, or it will provide a new, more clear and more urgent goal to overcome the challenges of the defeat.</li>
<li>It is not healthy when one is locked into a sense of Flow in only one sphere of his or her life.</li>
</ul>
