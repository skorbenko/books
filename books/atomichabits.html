<li><p>To write a good book, one has to become a good book.  </p></li>

<li><p>A crazy story about how James rebuilt his life after a baseball accident:  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>He was a senior in high school and was on the baseball team when a bat flew out of the batter’s hands and into James’ face.  </p></li>

<li><p>The bat broke his nose, eye sockets.  </p></li>

<li><p>James was rushed to the hospital, almost died.  </p></li>

<li><p>Applied habits to get back on track, and once that worked, used them to go above and beyond.  </p></li></ul></li>

<li><p>Habits have this powerful effect, therefore they build out systems as opposed to goals -- more useful in the long run.  </p></li>

<li><p>Goals are the results one wants to achieve, and systems are the processes that lead to said results.  </p></li>

<li><p>Winners and losers have the same goal - to win. We only interview the winners, so there is a confirmation bias.  </p></li>

<li><p>Goals restrict one’s happiness.  </p></li>

<li><p>Change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior.  </p></li>

<li><p>“Identity” derived from the Latin “essentitas”- being, and “identidem”, which means repeatedly.  </p></li>

<li><p>You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.  </p></li>

<li><p>Be 1% “better” every day.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>(1+0.01)^365=37.7834343329  </p></li>

<li><p>(1-0.01)^365=0.02551796445  </p></li></ul></li>

<li><p>When the habits are set up and healthy, one is free to work on the other aspects of one’s life.  </p></li>

<li><p><strong>Identity based habits &gt; Outcome based habits</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>You do not want to read a book, you want to become a voracious reader.  </p></li>

<li><p>You do not want to journal every once in a while, you want to be the person who journals every day.  </p></li>

<li><p>The identity is proven to oneself if one does the activity every day - works on the habit.  </p></li></ul></li>

<li><p><strong>How to Create a Good Habit:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>1 - Cue: Make it obvious  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Set your clothes out the night before so that it is easier to go out for a run than to change into formalwear.  </p></li>

<li><p>“Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” ― C.G. Jung  </p></li>

<li><p>One does not have to be the victim of one’s enviroment, but can be the architect.  </p></li>

<li><p>Society has created cues (dopamine-fueled feedback loops) that are much more powerful than anything our ancestors had.  </p></li></ul></li>

<li><p>2 - Craving: Make it attractive  </p></li>

<li><p>3 - Response: Make it easy  </p></li>

<li><p>4 - Reward: Make it satisfying  </p>

<ul>
<li>As opposed to B. F. Skinner’s  </li></ul></li></ul></li>

<li><p>Cue =&gt; routine =&gt; reward  </p></li>


<li><p><strong>How to Break a Bad Habit:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>1 - Cue: Make it invisible  </p></li>

<li><p>2 - Craving: Make it unattractive  </p></li>

<li><p>3 - Response: Make it difficult  </p></li>

<li><p>4 - Reward: Make it unsatisfying  </p></li></ul></li>

<li><p>If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit.  </p></li>

<li><p>Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start.  </p></li>

<li><p>Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act.  </p></li>

<li><p>Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it.  </p></li>

<li><p>And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur.</p></li>
<li><p>Without all four, the behavior will not be repeated.</p></li>
<li><p>Habit stacking - creating a domino effect where the reward of each habit is another habit, so the first habit acts as a cue.</p></li>
<li><p>Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be?</p></li>
<li><p>Implementation intention: “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”</p></li>
<li><p>People with a specific plan for when and where to perform a habit are much more likely to follow through</p>
<ul>
<li>When the predetermined moment occurs, there is no need to think, one just follows through.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Most people think they lack motivation, but they really just lack clarity.</p></li>
<li><p>People we imitate</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The close</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a 57% greater chance of becoming obese if one of your friends is obese.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The many</p>
<ul>
<li>When in doubt, humans look to the group.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The powerful</p></li>
<li><p>This is why mastermind groups are so powerful.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Take a break from the space where you do your daily work, which is also linked to your current thought patterns.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a separate space for work, study, exercise</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One space, one use.</p></li>
<li><p>So that each context is associated with each enviroment.</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore sleep will be easier in the bedroom when that is the only action that is done there.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Walk slowly, but never backwards.</p></li>
<li><p>90% of heroin addicts relapse once they return home to the same neighborhood with all the same cues.</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that you are learning means nothing if you do nothing with it.</p></li>
<li><p>Daydreaming about the vacation is often more enjoyable than being on vacation.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Life is predictive because every action is predicted before it is completed.</p></li>
<li><p>To master a habit, start with repetition, not perfection.</p></li>
<li><p>Look for every point of friction and eliminate it.</p></li>
<li><p>A good day vs. a bad day often comes down to a few productive achoices at decisive moments.</p>
<ul>
<li>The choices stack up throughout the days, weeks, months, quarters, years.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A new habit should take less than two minutes to do.</p></li>
<li><p>The habit of showing up is fundamental.</p></li>
<li><p>What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.</p></li>
<li><p>The costs of your good habits are in the present. The costs of your bad habits are in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Visual measures provide clear evidence of progress.</p></li>
<li><p>One must evade conflicting identities i.e. rewarding a gym session with a bowl of ice cream.</p></li>
<li><p>The act of tracking one’s behavior can create the urge to change it.</p></li>
<li><p>Habit tracking keeps one honest.</p></li>
<li><strong>Never fail more than once.</strong></li>
<li><p>One’s goal starts the habit.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s crucial to show up when you don’t feel like it.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand your nature to better your strategy.</p></li>
<li><p>Genes tell you where the odds are in your favor.</p></li>
<li><p>Tasks that are 4% tougher than one’s ability is much more fulfilling than tougher or easier tasks.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep a decision journal.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Topics to include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The decisions you make</p></li>
<li><p>Why you make them</p></li>
<li><p>The conditions for the decision</p></li>
<li><p>The context</p></li>
<li><p>What the expected outcome is</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Review it every week or every month.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Successful people show up despite the boredom and lack of willpower.</p></li>
<li><p>Professionals know what is important to them and work towards the goal with a purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>One’s identity creates a kind of “pride” that encourages one to deny one’s weak spots and prevents one from truly growing.</p></li>
<li><p>Happiness is the absence of desire.</p></li>
<li><p>Craving is the desire to fix anything and everything.</p></li>
<li><p>Emotions are a threat to decision making.</p></li>
</ul>
