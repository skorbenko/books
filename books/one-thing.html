<ul>
<li>Success leaves clues -- most successful companies are known for one thing only.</li>
<li>Extremely Pareto's principle:
<ul>
<li>(80%)^3 : (20%)^3 =&gt; 51.2% : 0.8%</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The 6 Lies</strong>
<ul>
<li>Everything Matters Equally -- some tasks have a larger impact.</li>
<li>Multitasking -- real multitasking does not exist. When one tries to "multitask" one is just continually switching between tasks, losing time on the transitions.</li>
<li>A Disciplined Life -- Life is not a marathon, it is a series of sprints. Success is a sprint just long enough to establish habits - from 18 to 254 days. No one is disciplined, people just train habits into their life. Some discipline is, however, required.</li>
<li>Willpower is always available on request -- willpower is able to be replenished via rest. What are my default answers? Introduce friction to stop default answers.</li>
<li>A Balanced Life -- does not exist. Sometimes one focuses on one area of life, sometime on the other, and then the leftover areas suffer a bit.</li>
<li>Big is Bad -- One must be open to the possibility that through the right things, one's life can become great.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>What is the one thing I can do such that by doing it, everything else can be easier or unnecessary?</strong> -- it is important to ask this question on a regular basis.
<ul>
<li>"Judge a man by his questions rather than his answers" - Voltaire</li>
<li>The goal should be big and specific.</li>
<li>Extraordinary results require a great answer and require one to live outside one's comfort zone -- go big or go home.</li>
<li>The goal must be so far out there so that if things continue as they are, there would be no way to achieve said goal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The 3 Commitments</strong>
<ul>
<li>Follow the path of mastery
<ul>
<li>Mastery is a path, not a destination</li>
<li>Mastery is giving the best one can to become the best one can be at one's most important work</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Move from E to P
<ul>
<li>Move from the entrepreneurial (natural) way of doing things to the purposeful.</li>
<li>Use systems and focus to drive up willpower to achieve grand things.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Live the accountability cycle
<ul>
<li>Do not settle for the victim mentality</li>
<li>One can either be the author of their life, or the victim of it</li>
<li>Figure out what you can control and manipulate that</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>The 4 Thieves</strong>
<ul>
<li>Inability to say no</li>
<li>Fear of chaos</li>
<li>Poor health habits</li>
<li>Environment does not support one's goals</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>   
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose, Priority, Productivity</strong>
<ul>
<li>What is your "why"? Without a "why", the destination of one's work/productivity is burnout.</li>
<li>Priority should only be used in the singular</li>
<li>Someday goal =&gt; five year goal =&gt; yearly goal =&gt; monthly goal =&gt; weekly goal =&gt; the one thing one can do today</li>
<li>Do not fall for hyperbolic discounting</li>
<li>Use timeblocking to commit time in advance
<ul>
<li>Schedule time off first</li>
<li>Maker vs. manager time</li>
<li>An hour per week to review one's goals</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Money is a metaphor for producing results
<ul>
<li>One's results come from the system one is using</li>
<li>Assign a dollar value to the system you are using</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
