While Gogol’s masterpiece induced deep gloom, Feuerbach had the opposite effect. Herzen describes his reaction in his memoirs: “After reading the first pages I leapt up with joy. Down with the trappings of masquerade; away with the stammering allegory. We are free men and not the slaves of Xanthos; there is no need for us to wrap the truth in myth.”

Belief in Providence, Feuerbach writes, “is belief in a power … in opposition to which all the power of reality is nothing. Providence cancels the laws of Nature; it interrupts the course of necessity, the iron bond which inevitably binds effects to causes.”

Those who seek to escape from this dilemma can find refuge in the fundamental dogmas of Christianity as “realized wishes of the heart”: “The essence of Christianity is the essence of human feeling. It is pleasanter to be passive than to act, to be redeemed and made free by another than to free one oneself, pleasanter to make one’s salvation depend on a person than on the force of one’s own spontaneity; pleasanter to set before oneself an object of love than an object of effort; pleasanter to know oneself beloved of God than merely to have that simple, natural self-love which is innate in all beings; pleasanter to see oneself imaged in the love-bearing eyes of another personal being than to look into the concave mirror of self or into the cold depths of the ocean of nature.”

In June 1842, an article by Ruge in the Jahrbücher prompts Herzen to reflect on the heroism demanded by consistency with one’s principles: Hegel’s attachment to the status quo (das Bestehende), which had led him to absolutize the Prussian state, would have led him also to disown the Young Hegelians, “ but the fact is that they were truer to him than he was himself.”

He was at his best in the destruction of idols, including those at whose shrines he himself had worshipped. His two “propaedeutic” works are interesting above all in what they reveal of the intellectual path already leading him toward the distinctive humanism that would set him at odds with all the major ideologies and political groupings of his time in Russia and the West.

“Savages” are dominated by their crudest instincts, whereas “barbarians,” deriving their rules from principle alone, tend toward unfeeling brutality. The former category he sees as exemplified by the French revolutionary mobs, the latter by the ideologues of the Terror. He attributes the Revolution’s failure to achieve its liberating goals to what would later be described as alienation—the fragmentation of the human psyche through the specialization demanded by the ever-increasing complexity and differentiation of modern societies. One activity represented an exception to this rule. The contemplation of beauty as “living shape” simultaneously engages the senses and the urge for form, activating a third component of our psyche, the “play drive,” which by its existence proves “the compatibility of our two natures, the practicability of the infinite being realized in the finite, hence the possibility of the sublimest humanity.” We emerge from the contemplation of beauty in a state Schiller describes as one of “active determinability”—a state from which “we shall with equal ease turn to seriousness or play, to repose or to movement, to compliance or to resistance, to the discursions of abstract thought or to the direct contemplation of phenomena.”104 Although praised by Hegel on its publication, Schiller’s work made little impact in his time. Its title laid it open to misinterpretation. He was not advocating a turn away from politics to art and self-cultivation. He does not question Kant’s distinction between beauty and the good, seeing his own prescription as a necessary but not sufficient condition for moral freedom—an intensification of our sense of what it means to be human, impelling us to live to our full potential. It is not an all-purpose formula or a way of freeing ourselves from moral choices, even less

In the West, the clash between church and state had been a force for progress; the Russian church had merely submitted slavishly to the temporal power. In Europe, autocracy had been “the disease of a single century”; in Russia it was officially proclaimed as the aim of the state, for which the population was a mere means.11 Hence their slavish mentality, reacting to oppression with either apathy or revolt (a reference to the Pugachevshchina, the great peasant revolt of 1773–1774, the specter of which continued to haunt the country’s rulers). Russians could only marvel at the English, with their “majestically calm” consciousness of their rights, protected by public opinion—a phenomenon unknown in Russia, where the question of rights was the subject of such confusion that the masses had on occasion resisted the development of the electoral principle, while the government treated demands for legality as rebellion.

Who Is to Blame? and The Thieving Magpie (a story he first published in 1848) satirize the injustice and brutality of Nicolas’s regime through a gallery of Gogolian grotesques: corrupt, parasitic, and heartless officials, and landowners who relieve the boredom of their idle lives by erotic conquests over their female serfs and liberal use of the whip. The reader is reminded of the punishments these all-powerful despots could administer on a whim. Sons could be sent off to the army to pay for the transgressions of their fathers, discarded mistresses were married off to the nearest peasant, while every serf faced the terror of the unknown: into whose hands would he fall after his master’s death?

Ogarev’s transformation of his estate followed no ideological blueprint, but the intention behind his reforms, encompassing health, education, and technical training, coincided with Proudhon’s view of the aim of social and economic progress: the achievement of “a general equation of our contradictions” through a new form of communitarian socialism to which each would contribute according to his capacities, and where initiative and expertise would be rewarded appropriately without detriment to the well-being of the less endowed

On the other hand, Herzen developed an intellectual affinity and a warm personal relationship with the anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. Like Proudhon, he would found his socialism on a radical critique of notions of power, authority, and freedom that were then as prevalent on the political Left as on the Right. Integrated into the Russian populist tradition, this critique would form the basis of its opposition to Marxism.

There is no coded certitude in this text. The intensity of psychic conflict in modern man, his obsessive yearning to be otherwise constituted than he is, had led all Proudhon’s socialist contemporaries to conclude that the moment of transformation was close.

Proudhon distinguishes between justice—the essential moral basis of social intercourse—and equity, variously defined as humanitas, urbanity, or politesse: the form the universal human instinct of solidarity takes in an intellectually and morally developed individual. It is equity that makes it “at one and the same time a duty and a pleasure to aid the weak … , to treat him as an equal, to give just tribute of recognition and honor to the strong without becoming his slave.”38 Pleasant and agreeable to all, equity can make distinctions between ranks, virtues, and capacities without causing offense. Without compromising justice, equity can enhance it with the qualities of aesthetic taste, love, esteem, and the human capacity to idealize.

They had developed their ideas in vastly different circumstances—Proudhon in the process of conflicts in person and in print with opponents of all political persuasions, Herzen in solitary reflections or discussions within his small circle on philosophy, science, and history. But Herzen’s “speculative empiricism” and Proudhon’s “practical atheism” were attempts to confront the same dilemma.

In the aftermath of 1848 Proudhon’s views on the ends and means of social transformation had succeeded in alienating him from radicals and moderates alike. In contrast to both groups he described himself as a defender both of progress and conservation.40 In terms of practical tactics, this meant the attempt to work for social reform through a resolution of the conflict between social groups and classes. He believed that the bourgeoisie could be shown that their economic interests were not at odds with those of the workers: they had a common concern in eliminating the economic parasitism of the “oisifs.”

The dismal records of totalitarian democracy and laissez-faire liberalism have led to increasing emphasis in political philosophy on the distinction between “positive” and “negative” liberty—the first representing freedom to lead a way of life conforming to one’s rational nature, to be achieved through participation in a community sharing the same goals and values; the second denoting freedom to act on one’s own terms, with the minimum of coercion and constraint.

Written in the form of a letter to Georg Herwegh, his first contribution, “La Russie,” appeared in Proudhon’s paper in November and December 1849, followed in April 1850 by an open letter to Mazzini.

As a portrait of his generation, this passage carries scant conviction.

In this letter he envisages an era in which the educated minority would apply their knowledge and libertarian ideals to the task of securing the future of the commune and its rights to land as a safeguard against the creation of a proletariat on a Western model, or “state communism”—the death of individual liberty.

The brief period of unanimity with which educated society welcomed Alexander II’s reforming intentions ends when Herzen rejects the moderates’ request that the Bell cease to carp at the tsar’s delay in spelling out these intentions. The intransigence of his criticism of the government helps to radicalize the young generation, who soon outstrip him in revolutionary fervor. In the early 1860s the threat posed by the latter to Russia’s stability creates a backlash in the form of a new conservatism that, in struggling against the Left, acquires many of their qualities, including a tendency to all-or-nothing positions and a contempt for liberal gradualism.

The foundations of the étatist school of Russian historiography were laid by the young Moscow historian Konstantin Kavelin in an essay of 1847, which presents the central features of Russian history as the development of the “principle of individuality” characteristic of modern European societies, at the expense of the primitive “patrimonial” principle. But whereas in Europe (according to Hegel’s triune schema) the instrument of this development had been civil society, in Russia, Kavelin argues, it had been the state.

Kavelin’s essay established his reputation as an effective polemicist against the Slavophile version of Russian history. His status as a historian ensured him a dominant place among those greeting the reforming intentions of a tsar who seemed to embody the state as agent of progress. His memorandum of 1855, “On the Emancipation of the Peasants in Russia,” figured prominently in discussions on this subject in liberal circles of the time. It emphasized the social and economic advantages of a post-reform free-enterprise economy based on private ownership of land, making the point that the terms of the Emancipation should safeguard the interests of the gentry while not being so detrimental to the peasantry as to create a landless proletariat. In a second essay, published in 1859, he suggests retaining a limited form of communal tenure alongside private land ownership as a counterbalance to the excesses of uncontrolled capitalist development and a safety net for the weakest sections of the population, who might otherwise be seduced by socialist propaganda.

It has been said of Humboldt that he enlarges one’s sense of what a liberal theory may be.46 The same is true of Mill. His mental breakdown having taught him that human needs were too complex to be explicable in terms of any unitary system of rational purposes, he began to seek illumination from mutually exclusive doctrines—a procedure that, as Isaiah Berlin has commented, was “greatly daring” in one brought up in a puritanical Benthamite radicalism.

This “penitential theology of a God-less universe” (as Joseph Stern describes it)67 can be seen as an activist variation on the Schopenhauerian theme of self-renunciation of a will irrevocably at odds with a meaningless reality.

German book, in which the laborious existence of the mole is described—it is very funny. The little beast, with big paws and little chinks instead of eyes, digs in the dark, underground, in the damp, tunnels day and night, without weariness, without diversion, with passionate persistence. It barely stops to have a bite—some little grains and worms, and sets to work again; but in return for all this the hole is ready for the sons, and the mole dies in peace; and the sons begin boring holes in all directions for their own sons. What is the price paid for a lifetime of toil underground? What relation is there between effort and attainment? Ha, ha, ha!” The book in question is Schopenhauer’s Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,

There was a more important reason why the newly awakened urge for enlightenment was bound to concentrate on the natural sciences: “They provided genuine knowledge, because their evidence was based not on mere speculation, but on observation … and experiment, leaving little room for equivocation. We stood in need of something unambiguous in order to cope with the mass of problems that were showering down on us. It is not surprising that we sometimes expected science to do what is not on its agenda.”14

The values of the new enlighteners were disseminated through literary criticism, which Belinsky had made the vehicle for radical propaganda in Russia. The campaign began with the publication in 1855 of Chernyshevsky’s notorious dissertation: On the Aesthetic Relations between Art and Reality. The target was carefully chosen. All that the new men most detested in their predecessors’ approach to the world was, they believed, epitomized in the prevailing idealist aesthetics, according to which art was a pathway to an understanding of the essence of the universe.

Tata, with her sympathy for things Russian, was the repository of his last hope for a continuation of the work he and Ogarev had begun.36

The bourgeois world could not be destroyed by gunpowder alone.
